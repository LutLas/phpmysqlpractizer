<br/>
<p>
<em><strong>In Short:</strong>  If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em>
</p>
<br/>

Our Apps offer you the ability to register and login using your third party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, e-mail address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public.
</p>
<br/>

We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
</p>
<br/>

<h3><strong>

</strong></h3>
<br/>
<p>
<em><strong>In Short:</strong>  We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</em>

No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 6 months past the termination of the user's account.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3><strong>
8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
</strong></h3>
<br/>
<p>
<em><strong>In Short:</strong>  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Apps is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3><strong>
9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
</strong></h3>
<br/>
<p>
<em><strong>In Short:</strong>  In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.">here</a>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us <a href="mailto:administrator@masteredsite.com?subject=Privacy Policy Feedback">here</a>.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<strong>Account Information</strong>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Log into your account settings and update your user account.</li>
    <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>

</p>
<br/>
<p>
<strong><u>Cookies and similar technologies:</u></strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Apps.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<strong><u>Opting out of email marketing:</u></strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below.

</p>

<ul>
	<li>Access your account settings and update preferences.</li>

<br/>
<h3><strong>
10. DATA BREACH
</strong></h3>
<br/>
<p>
A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when MasteredSite believes you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that MasteredSite becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information MasteredSite will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3><strong>
11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
</strong></h3>
<br/>
<p>
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3><strong>
12. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?
</strong></h3>
<br/>
<p>
<em><strong>In Short:</strong>  Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Apps, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Apps. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Apps, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3><strong>
13. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?
</strong></h3>
<br/>
<p>
<em><strong>In Short:</strong>  Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
